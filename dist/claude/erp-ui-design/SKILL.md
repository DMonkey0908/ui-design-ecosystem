name: erp-ui-design
description: Design, build, restyle or review dense dark-chrome ERP / admin / back-office interfaces - app shells with a sidebar and topbar, data tables, filter rows, forms, KPI tiles, status pills and analytics charts. Use it whenever creating or changing how any internal-tool screen looks: spacing, colour, typography, density, states, motion or layout; when adding or restyling a table, form, chart, dialog, menu or empty state; when asked to make an admin panel, operations console, back-office screen or internal dashboard look better, cleaner or more professional; when asked to make a UI "look like a real ERP" (SAP / Oracle / Dynamics) rather than a consumer SaaS; or when a screen must stay readable through a full working day. Not for marketing sites, landing pages, consumer mobile apps or content-first reading experiences.

# ERP & back-office

## Applies whenever you are about to

- create, style or lay out **any** user interface — a page, a screen, a
  component, a view
- change how an existing interface **looks**: spacing, colour, type, density,
  states, motion, layout
- add or restyle a **chart**, table, form, dialog, menu, toast or empty state
- answer "make this look better / more professional / cleaner"
- review or critique a UI, someone else's or your own

It applies to any stack — HTML and CSS, React, Vue, Svelte, Tailwind, SwiftUI,
Flutter, a design token file. The rules are about the interface, not the
framework.

It does **not** apply to work that never reaches a screen: build config, data
layers, tests of non-visual logic.

## Do this before writing the first line

1. **Check the tokens.** If the project has a token or theme file, use it. If it
   does not, create one before you write a colour — a hex typed into a component
   is the first step of every palette that later has ninety of them.
2. **Name the surface** you are working on: chrome, canvas, content, floating.
   The treatment follows from the surface, not from the component's name.
3. **Read the reference for what you are building** if it is not already in
   context. A partial memory of a spacing scale produces something almost right,
   which is harder to spot than something obviously wrong.
4. **Write the code.**
5. **Run the review checklist** before reporting the work done.

## Never do these, whatever the request

They are cheap to get right and expensive to retrofit, and every one of them
has shipped from an assistant that had the rules available and did not apply
them.

- Ship an accent colour with a single value when the interface has both light
  and dark surfaces.
- Write a raw colour outside the token file.
- Leave a figure without `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- Remove a focus outline without replacing it.
- Use colour as the only signal for a state.
- Put information or an action behind hover alone. On a touchscreen it is not
  awkward, it is absent.
- Show a spinner for work that finishes in under 300ms, or leave one spinning
  past a second where a skeleton at the real dimensions belongs.
- Animate without honouring `prefers-reduced-motion`, including the end state.
- Start a value axis anywhere but zero when magnitude is being compared.

## When the request conflicts with a rule

Name the cost in one sentence, offer the nearest thing that works, then build
whatever is decided — it is their product. Do not silently comply, and do not
refuse.

Two exceptions are not negotiable, because their cost lands on someone who is
not in the room: the accessibility minimums, and the chart honesty rules. For
those, build the compliant version and say why.

## Say what you applied

When UI work is done, state in one line which pack and which rules shaped it.
A user who cannot see that this system is active cannot tell it from your
default behaviour, and cannot correct it.

---

A complete design system for internal business software, extracted from a
production ERP front end. It is opinionated on purpose: the decisions below were
made for operators who sit in front of the same five screens for eight hours,
not for a landing page that has to win a first impression.

## The domain thesis

**Chrome is dark. Content is white. The accent only marks state and action.**

The sidebar and topbar are near-black and recede. Every surface that holds
something a person reads, compares or edits — cards, tables, dropdowns, form
fields — stays white. One brand accent marks the selected item, the primary
action and the data series, and nothing else.

This is what separates an ERP from a consumer dashboard. A consumer dashboard
uses colour to create delight. An ERP uses colour as a *signal*, so when
something is red it means something. Spend the accent anywhere else and you have
spent the only tool you had for saying "look here".

## What this pack adds on top of core

Core already requires per-surface accents, visible focus, tabular numerals and
honest axes. This pack decides the things core deliberately leaves open:

- **Density.** 13px base, `8px 12px` table cells, 20+ rows visible at 1080p.
  Comfortable consumer spacing means a third fewer rows per screen, which for an
  operator is a real cost rather than a matter of taste.
- **Surface assignment.** Chrome dark and content white, permanently and
  simultaneously — not a theme toggle.
- **Corner radii inverted from the usual.** Chrome is *sharper* than content
  (2–4px against 6–12px). Square corners on the shell read as structural, a
  window frame; soft corners on content read as touchable. Getting this backwards
  is what makes an ERP look like a consumer app wearing a dark theme.
- **A flat elevation model.** Borders separate things; shadow is reserved for
  what genuinely floats. The shell itself never has one.
- **One container.** A card, with a consistent head. No panel/box/section
  variants — a dense page stays scannable because every container is the same
  shape.

## Non-negotiables

Apply these without being asked.

- **`assets/theme.css` is the only file that names a colour.** Everything else
  spends it. A new colour is a new token there, and a token that only one page
  uses is still better than a literal.
- **Density is the point.** Do not quietly relax it because a screen looks
  tight. Offer a density toggle instead.
- **`tabular-nums` on every figure.** Tables, tiles, axis labels, tooltips.
- **Motion is 0.12s–0.22s.** Anything slower is felt as lag by someone
  performing the same action 200 times a day.
- **One primary button per card.** Two accent-filled buttons and the accent
  stops meaning "the action".
- **The number on a KPI tile is never coloured.** Tinting it green or red passes
  judgement on a figure that may be neither; put the judgement in the sub-line
  where it can be worded.

## What this pack deliberately refuses

Say so briefly if asked for one of these, then offer the alternative and build
whatever is decided.

| Request | Cost | Offer instead |
|---|---|---|
| Glassmorphism on cards | Contrast on the data, which is the whole budget | A border and a flat off-white fill |
| Bigger, airier spacing | A third fewer rows per screen | A density toggle, defaulting to compact |
| A colour per module | The accent stops signalling state | One accent; distinguish by icon and label |
| 16px rounded cards | Reads consumer, not operational | 8px — soft without being playful |
| Animated page transitions | Felt as lag at the 200th repetition | Instant navigation with a 150ms content fade |
| Icon-only buttons, no label | A support ticket, in a tool people are trained on | An icon with a label, or a real accessible name |

If they hear the cost and still want it, build it. It is their product.

## Getting started on a new project

1. Copy `assets/theme.css` in as the first stylesheet, then swap the accent
   block for the client's colour — and recompute the on-dark value.
2. Start the page from `assets/page-template.html`, with `assets/erp-shell.css`
   and `assets/erp-shell.js` beside `theme.css`. The inline script in the
   template's `<head>` is not optional; see the shell reference.
3. Keep the stylesheet order: theme → shell → page.

## What this domain assumes about the input

**Designed for a mouse or trackpad at desk distance.** The method is in `09-input.md`; this is what this domain assumes.

## How to use this skill

Read **`core/`** for the rules that hold for any interface, and **`pack/`**
for what this domain decided. A pack file never repeats a core rule, so when
the two are both relevant you need both.

Start with `core/01-tokens.md`, `core/03-layout.md`, `core/99-review.md`.

### Core - applies to every interface

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `core/01-tokens.md` | Tokens |
| `core/02-typography.md` | Typography |
| `core/03-layout.md` | Layout |
| `core/04-motion.md` | Motion |
| `core/05-accessibility.md` | Accessibility |
| `core/06-i18n.md` | Internationalisation |
| `core/07-charts.md` | Charts |
| `core/08-feedback.md` | Feedback |
| `core/09-input.md` | Input |
| `core/10-visual-language.md` | Visual language |
| `core/99-review.md` | Review |

### Pack - this domain

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `pack/01-surfaces.md` | Surfaces, palette and scales |
| `pack/02-shell.md` | The shell - sidebar, topbar, responsive |
| `pack/03-components.md` | Components |
| `pack/04-charts.md` | Charts - the ERP layer |
| `pack/05-checklist.md` | Domain review checklist |

### Assets

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `assets/theme.css` | the token file - drop into a new project |
| `assets/erp-shell.css` | the shell - grid, sidebar, topbar, main; written entirely in theme tokens |
| `assets/erp-shell.js` | the shell's behaviour - sidebar toggle, topbar menus, the active-item guard; no dependencies |
| `assets/page-template.html` | the page template, including the pre-paint script |

Before calling any work done, run `core/99-review.md` and then
`pack/05-checklist.md`.
