# Activation

This block is injected at the top of every generated build. It is the part that
must stay short, because on some targets it is in context on every request.

Its job is to convert a reference document into a reflex: without it, an
assistant has the rules available and still writes UI the way it always has,
then cites the rules afterwards if challenged.

---

## Applies whenever you are about to

- create, style or lay out **any** user interface — a page, a screen, a
  component, a view
- change how an existing interface **looks**: spacing, colour, type, density,
  states, motion, layout
- add or restyle a **chart**, table, form, dialog, menu, toast or empty state
- answer "make this look better / more professional / cleaner"
- review or critique a UI, someone else's or your own

It applies to any stack — HTML and CSS, React, Vue, Svelte, Tailwind, SwiftUI,
Flutter, a design token file. The rules are about the interface, not the
framework.

It does **not** apply to work that never reaches a screen: build config, data
layers, tests of non-visual logic.

## Do this before writing the first line

1. **Check the tokens.** If the project has a token or theme file, use it. If it
   does not, create one before you write a colour — a hex typed into a component
   is the first step of every palette that later has ninety of them.
2. **Name the surface** you are working on: chrome, canvas, content, floating.
   The treatment follows from the surface, not from the component's name.
3. **Read the reference for what you are building** if it is not already in
   context. A partial memory of a spacing scale produces something almost right,
   which is harder to spot than something obviously wrong.
4. **Write the code.**
5. **Run the review checklist** before reporting the work done.

## Never do these, whatever the request

They are cheap to get right and expensive to retrofit, and every one of them
has shipped from an assistant that had the rules available and did not apply
them.

- Ship an accent colour with a single value when the interface has both light
  and dark surfaces.
- Write a raw colour outside the token file.
- Leave a figure without `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- Remove a focus outline without replacing it.
- Use colour as the only signal for a state.
- Put information or an action behind hover alone. On a touchscreen it is not
  awkward, it is absent.
- Show a spinner for work that finishes in under 300ms, or leave one spinning
  past a second where a skeleton at the real dimensions belongs.
- Animate without honouring `prefers-reduced-motion`, including the end state.
- Start a value axis anywhere but zero when magnitude is being compared.
- Add an icon the user loses nothing without. An icon replaces a word where
  there is no room for one, or carries a state beside the text; beside a
  heading, on every card or in every row it is noise. `11-restraint.md`.
- Put an emoji in the interface's own text — headings, buttons, labels,
  statuses, empty states. It renders differently per platform, is read aloud
  by name, and ignores every token.
- Add a section, badge, figure or decoration the request did not ask for and
  the data does not support. It is either a commitment nobody agreed to
  maintain or a fabrication.

## When the request conflicts with a rule

Name the cost in one sentence, offer the nearest thing that works, then build
whatever is decided — it is their product. Do not silently comply, and do not
refuse.

Two exceptions are not negotiable, because their cost lands on someone who is
not in the room: the accessibility minimums, and the chart honesty rules. For
those, build the compliant version and say why.

## Say what you applied

When UI work is done, state in one line which pack and which rules shaped it.
A user who cannot see that this system is active cannot tell it from your
default behaviour, and cannot correct it.
