A design system for something a person installed, carries, and opens for
twenty seconds at a time. They are holding it in one hand, often while doing
something else, and they will be interrupted before they finish — by a
notification, a stop announcement, a person talking to them.

## The domain thesis

**Everything the hand does belongs in the bottom third. Everything above it is
a display, not a control.**

The thumb of a hand holding a phone sweeps an arc, and that arc does not reach
the top corners. Getting there means regripping, which needs the other hand, or
a small controlled drop of the device. People learn very quickly not to use
controls that cost them that, and what they learn is that the feature does not
work — not that it is badly placed.

So reach outranks visual hierarchy, and the two ask different questions. *What
is this screen about* is answered at the top, where the eye lands. *What will
they do on it* is answered at the bottom, where the thumb already is. A design
that puts the primary action at the top has answered the first question twice
and the second one not at all.

This is the rule the other packs reject. The `erp` pack puts its actions in a
topbar, correctly, because a cursor reaches the top of a 27-inch display faster
than anywhere else — the edges are infinite and the corners are free. Invert
this pack onto a desktop and you get a toolbar marooned at the bottom of a
screen nobody looks at; invert the desktop onto a phone and you get the
hamburger menu in the top-left corner, the single least reachable pixel on the
device.

**The second half of the thesis: the session ends without warning.** A desktop
app is closed. A phone app is *interrupted* — backgrounded mid-sentence,
killed by the OS an hour later, reopened cold at a train station. Every screen
here is designed to be survivable at any frame: what the user typed is still
there, where they were is still there, and nothing was lost because a phone
call arrived. A flow that only works when run start to finish in one sitting is
a flow that fails most of the time, quietly, and looks like the user changing
their mind.

**If your user is sitting at a desk with a mouse, you are in the wrong pack.**

## What this pack adds on top of core

Core already sets the method — target size follows pointer precision, hover is
a capability rather than a given, the waiting affordance follows the clock.
This pack decides what core leaves open:

- **Density: comfortable, and not negotiable downward.** 17pt / 16sp body,
  44pt minimum row height, 16pt screen margins. The `erp` pack's 13px base
  would be legible here and untappable, which is the distinction this pack
  exists to hold: on a phone, density is limited by the finger, not by the eye.
- **Surface assignment: the content is the canvas.** There is no page
  background behind a page. Chrome is translucent and sits *over* the content
  rather than framing it, so the content reads as continuing underneath — which
  it does, and which is why the safe-area insets exist.
- **The list row is the default container, not the card.** A card costs
  horizontal room on both sides to create a separation an inset divider already
  provides, on the axis a phone has least of. Cards earn their place when items
  differ in weight — a feed of mixed media — and not when twenty things are the
  same kind of thing.
- **Sheets, not dialogs.** A sheet rises from the edge the thumb is at, is
  dismissed by dragging in the direction the hand already moves, and can be
  partially expanded so the screen behind stays visible. A centre-screen dialog
  puts its buttons where the thumb is not and fights the system back gesture.
- **Motion is short and directional.** Within core's bands, at the fast end,
  and it always says where the screen came from: a push moves in from the edge
  it will return to. Motion on a phone is the only thing that explains a
  navigation model with no visible hierarchy.
- **Platform conventions win over house style.** Back is where the platform
  puts back. The share icon is the platform's share icon. Core's argument about
  not breaking conventions users brought with them is sharpest here, because
  the conventions were installed by the operating system before your app was.

## Overrides

**Core says: never remove functionality at a smaller size — change its form.
This pack removes it.**

Core's rule protects a responsive layout from quietly dropping features as the
viewport narrows, and it is right about that. It is not a mandate to fit a
desktop feature set onto a phone.

An annual report with twelve columns, a bulk editor, an admin console — the
compacted phone version of each of these is worse than an honest absence,
because it looks like the feature and does not work like it. The rule this pack
substitutes: **absent and linked beats present and unusable.** Say what is not
here, say where it is, and make the link work. What is never acceptable is the
third option, where the feature appears to be present and silently does less.

Nothing else in core is overridden. The accessibility minimums and the chart
honesty rules are not overridable at all.

## Non-negotiables

Apply these without being asked.

- **The primary action sits in the reachable arc**, at the bottom, full width
  or near it. If a screen has one thing to do, the thumb should not have to
  hunt for it.
- **Destructive actions are never adjacent to frequent ones.** Distance is the
  cheapest confirmation available, and it costs nothing to the people who are
  not about to make a mistake.
- **Safe-area insets are read, never hardcoded.** A bottom bar with a fixed
  padding value sits under the home indicator on one device and floats above
  nothing on another. The notch, the indicator and the keyboard are runtime
  values.
- **Every gesture has a visible equivalent.** Swipe-to-delete is a shortcut for
  people who know it exists. The row still needs a way to be deleted that can
  be discovered by looking at it.
- **The keyboard never covers the field being typed into**, nor the button that
  submits it. This is the single most common mobile form bug and it is
  invisible on a simulator with a hardware keyboard attached.
- **State survives backgrounding.** Assume the process is killed between any
  two frames. Draft text, scroll position and which step of a flow they were on
  are all restored, or the flow is short enough that losing it costs nothing.
- **Nothing depends on hover.** There is no hover. A long-press is not a
  substitute — it is undiscoverable unless something teaches it.
- **Icons are spent on the tab bar, the platform symbols and row types.** A
  leading icon in a row earns its place when it tells one kind of row from
  another — a transfer from a card payment — and not when every row has the
  same one. Not beside section headers, not on buttons that are already
  labelled. A phone screen has the least room of any, and a glyph that says
  nothing takes it from one that does. The test is `core/11-restraint.md`.

## What this pack deliberately refuses

Say the cost briefly, offer the alternative, then build whatever is decided.

| Request | Cost | Offer instead |
|---|---|---|
| A hamburger menu for primary navigation | Navigation hidden behind the least reachable pixel on the device, and usage of everything inside it collapses | A tab bar of three to five, with the rest under a "More" tab |
| A centre-screen modal dialog | Buttons land where the thumb is not, and it fights the system back gesture | A bottom sheet, dismissible by drag and by back |
| A data table | Horizontal scrolling that fights the vertical scroll, and text at a size nobody reads | A list row carrying the two fields that matter, with the rest on tap |
| Cards for a list of uniform items | Two margins per item, spent on a separation an inset divider already gives, on the axis you have least of | Rows with inset dividers; keep cards for mixed-weight content |
| An animated splash screen | Time spent in the exact moment a user is most likely to leave | A static launch image that matches the first frame of the real screen |
| An onboarding carousel before first use | Five screens of promises before the app has earned any attention | Let them in, and teach each thing at the moment it is first needed |
| A toast for an error that needs a decision | It leaves while they are still reading it | An inline error at the field, or a sheet carrying the action |
| A small close button in a top corner | The hardest target on the screen, for the action people need most when lost | Drag-to-dismiss, plus a full-width Done in the reachable arc |
| The same icon at the start of every row | A column of identical glyphs costs the row its widest cell and distinguishes nothing | An avatar, a type icon where types differ, or no leading element |
| Tighter spacing "to fit more in" | Targets below the floor, and a screen that fails for anyone with imprecise hands | Cut content, or move the rest one tap deeper |

If they hear the cost and still want it, build it. It is their product.

## Getting started on a new project

1. Copy `assets/tokens.json` in, and generate the platform file from it — the
   CSS custom properties in `assets/tokens.css` show the shape. Swap the accent
   and recompute the on-dark value before writing a single screen.

   On a web target, `assets/patterns.css` goes in after it. **This pack ships
   tokens and mechanism, not components** — unlike `erp`, whose shell is one
   copyable stylesheet — because the same screen is as likely to be SwiftUI or
   Compose, where a stylesheet is no help. What is shipped as CSS is the part
   that is pure mechanism and gets reinvented wrongly: safe areas, the row that
   grows, the pressed state on a device with no hover.
2. Decide the navigation model before the first screen: how many tabs, and what
   is deliberately not one. Retrofitting a tab bar means re-rooting every
   screen in the app.
3. Establish the safe-area handling once, in the screen container, so no
   individual screen has to think about it. Every screen doing its own is how
   one of them ends up under the home indicator.
4. Build the interrupted case first for any flow longer than one screen. It is
   the case that actually happens, and building it last means rewriting the
   state model.
