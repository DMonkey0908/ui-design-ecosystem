# Consumer web - UI design system

This project uses the `consumer-web` UI design system. The rules are on disk
next to this file, under `ui/`. **This file is the index, not the system.**

## Applies whenever you are about to

- create, style or lay out **any** user interface — a page, a screen, a
  component, a view
- change how an existing interface **looks**: spacing, colour, type, density,
  states, motion, layout
- add or restyle a **chart**, table, form, dialog, menu, toast or empty state
- answer "make this look better / more professional / cleaner"
- review or critique a UI, someone else's or your own

It applies to any stack — HTML and CSS, React, Vue, Svelte, Tailwind, SwiftUI,
Flutter, a design token file. The rules are about the interface, not the
framework.

It does **not** apply to work that never reaches a screen: build config, data
layers, tests of non-visual logic.

## Do this before writing the first line

1. **Check the tokens.** If the project has a token or theme file, use it. If it
   does not, create one before you write a colour — a hex typed into a component
   is the first step of every palette that later has ninety of them.
2. **Name the surface** you are working on: chrome, canvas, content, floating.
   The treatment follows from the surface, not from the component's name.
3. **Read the reference for what you are building** if it is not already in
   context. A partial memory of a spacing scale produces something almost right,
   which is harder to spot than something obviously wrong.
4. **Write the code.**
5. **Run the review checklist** before reporting the work done.

## Never do these, whatever the request

They are cheap to get right and expensive to retrofit, and every one of them
has shipped from an assistant that had the rules available and did not apply
them.

- Ship an accent colour with a single value when the interface has both light
  and dark surfaces.
- Write a raw colour outside the token file.
- Leave a figure without `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- Remove a focus outline without replacing it.
- Use colour as the only signal for a state.
- Put information or an action behind hover alone. On a touchscreen it is not
  awkward, it is absent.
- Show a spinner for work that finishes in under 300ms, or leave one spinning
  past a second where a skeleton at the real dimensions belongs.
- Animate without honouring `prefers-reduced-motion`, including the end state.
- Start a value axis anywhere but zero when magnitude is being compared.
- Add an icon the user loses nothing without. An icon replaces a word where
  there is no room for one, or carries a state beside the text; beside a
  heading, on every card or in every row it is noise. `11-restraint.md`.
- Put an emoji in the interface's own text — headings, buttons, labels,
  statuses, empty states. It renders differently per platform, is read aloud
  by name, and ignores every token.
- Add a section, badge, figure or decoration the request did not ask for and
  the data does not support. It is either a commitment nobody agreed to
  maintain or a fabrication.

## When the request conflicts with a rule

Name the cost in one sentence, offer the nearest thing that works, then build
whatever is decided — it is their product. Do not silently comply, and do not
refuse.

Two exceptions are not negotiable, because their cost lands on someone who is
not in the room: the accessibility minimums, and the chart honesty rules. For
those, build the compliant version and say why.

## Say what you applied

When UI work is done, state in one line which pack and which rules shaped it.
A user who cannot see that this system is active cannot tell it from your
default behaviour, and cannot correct it.

## Read the file before you write the code

Opening one reference costs a single tool call. Working from a
half-remembered spacing scale produces something *almost* right, which is
harder for a reviewer to catch than something obviously wrong - and it is
what this system exists to prevent. Do not answer from this index.

## The thesis, so you know what you are applying

**You are designing for the first five seconds, not the two-hundredth use.**

Every decision here follows from that. Space is not waste — it is what lets a
stranger find the one thing the screen is about. Type is not a setting — it is
most of what they judge you on before reading a word. A page that fits more
above the fold is not a better page; it is a page that asked a stranger to do
work before it earned any.

This is the exact inverse of an operational tool, and the two are not reconcilable.
The `erp` pack packs twenty rows onto a screen because an operator returns to it
daily and every row saved is a scroll saved. Do that here and the page reads as
a spreadsheet someone forgot to design. Do the reverse there and an operator
loses a third of their working set to whitespace.

**If you are building something a trained user returns to daily, you are in the
wrong pack.**

**Designed for a finger on a held device.** Also reached with a mouse or trackpad at desk distance. Interactive targets are at least 44px. The method is in `09-input.md`; this is what this domain assumes.

## Hard rules - apply even before you open anything

- Use the project token file. Never write a raw colour outside it; if there is no token file, create one first.
- An accent needs one value per surface. A colour chosen to read on a light surface disappears on a dark one.
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on every figure - tables, tiles, axis labels, tooltips.
- Never remove a focus outline without replacing it. Always `:focus-visible`, never `:focus`.
- Colour is never the only signal for a state. Pair it with an icon, a label or a position.
- Never put information or an action behind hover alone - a touchscreen has no hover, so it is absent rather than awkward.
- Match the waiting affordance to the wait: nothing under 300ms, a skeleton at real dimensions past a second, cancellable progress past five.
- `min-width: 0` on grid and flex children that can hold wide content; `minmax(0, 1fr)` on tracks.
- Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`, and state the end value explicitly - `opacity: revert` yields 1, not your value.
- Start a value axis at zero whenever magnitude is compared.
- No icon the user loses nothing without: an icon replaces a word where there is no room, or carries a state beside the text - never one per heading, card or row.
- No emoji in the interface's own text - headings, buttons, labels, statuses, empty states.
- Add nothing the request did not ask for and the data does not support: no extra sections, badges, invented figures or decoration.
- Say which rules shaped the result when you are done.

## Not for

- internal tools, admin panels and operations consoles - use the erp pack, which is built for the opposite reader
- dense data entry or any screen an operator works in all day
- data tables that must show twenty or more rows at once
- native mobile app interfaces, which have their own navigation conventions and touch targets
