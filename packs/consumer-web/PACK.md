A design system for pages read by strangers. Someone arrived from a search
result, an ad or a link someone sent them. They owe you nothing, they will not
be trained, and they will leave the moment the page stops being worth the
scroll.

## The domain thesis

**You are designing for the first five seconds, not the two-hundredth use.**

Every decision here follows from that. Space is not waste — it is what lets a
stranger find the one thing the screen is about. Type is not a setting — it is
most of what they judge you on before reading a word. A page that fits more
above the fold is not a better page; it is a page that asked a stranger to do
work before it earned any.

This is the exact inverse of an operational tool, and the two are not reconcilable.
The `erp` pack packs twenty rows onto a screen because an operator returns to it
daily and every row saved is a scroll saved. Do that here and the page reads as
a spreadsheet someone forgot to design. Do the reverse there and an operator
loses a third of their working set to whitespace.

**If you are building something a trained user returns to daily, you are in the
wrong pack.**

## What this pack adds on top of core

Core already requires per-surface accents, visible focus, honest axes and
tabular numerals. This pack decides the things core deliberately leaves open:

- **Density: low.** 16px base — the browser default, not a shrunk one.
  Section rhythm at 96–128px. Measure capped at 60–75 characters. The page is
  read, not worked in.
- **Surface assignment: the canvas is the content.** There is no permanent
  chrome. The header floats over the page and gets out of the way; a card is a
  deliberate choice for grouping, not the default container. A page made of
  cards on a grey background is an admin panel wearing a marketing headline.
- **Radii and elevation: softer and lifted.** 8–16px on interactive surfaces,
  a warm soft shadow to raise the primary action. Where the `erp` pack uses a
  border to separate, this uses space.
- **Motion can be expressive**, within core's bands, because most of it happens
  once per visit rather than two hundred times a day. Scroll-linked reveals are
  allowed; blocking content behind them is not.
- **Performance is a design constraint, not an afterthought.** A hero image
  that takes four seconds has already lost the five seconds this pack is built
  around. `04-performance.md` treats LCP, CLS and font loading as design
  decisions, because that is what they are.

## Overrides

**Core says one type family plus a monospace. This pack uses two.**

Brand voice is a deliverable here rather than a nice-to-have, and a display
face is the cheapest way to stop a page reading as a template. Core's objection
is real, so the cost is paid explicitly rather than ignored: both families are
self-hosted and subset, the display face is preloaded, both declare
`font-display: swap` with metric-matched fallbacks, and the pairing stops at
two. A third brand family is not a style decision, it is a bug.

The override replaces "one family", not "plus a monospace". Where a page shows
an identifier a reader will copy — a model code, a part number — core's
monospace still applies, taken from the system stack so it costs no request.

The font files are not in this pack. The builder supplies them, or ships the
system fallback stack deliberately; `04-performance.md` says which is which.

Nothing else in core is overridden. The accessibility minimums and the chart
honesty rules are not overridable at all.

## Non-negotiables

Apply these without being asked.

- **One primary action per screenful.** Two competing calls to action halve
  each other. Everything else is a link or a secondary button.
- **The measure is capped.** 60–75 characters. A paragraph running the full
  width of a 1600px container will not be read, however good the copy is.
- **Type carries the hierarchy, not colour.** Size, weight and space first.
  Coloured headings are a symptom of a scale that is not doing its job.
- **Nothing important is revealed only on scroll.** The headline, the primary
  action and what the product actually is must survive JavaScript failing.
- **No layout shift.** Every image, embed and font has its space reserved
  before it loads. A page that moves under a reader's thumb is a page they
  stop trusting.
- **The page works before the JavaScript does.** Content in HTML, links that
  are links, forms that submit.

## What this pack deliberately refuses

Say so briefly, offer the alternative, and build whatever is decided.

| Request | Cost | Offer instead |
|---|---|---|
| A carousel for the hero | Nobody sees slide two, and it moves the headline under the reader | One decisive hero; put the rest in sections below |
| An entry pop-up | It interrupts before the page has earned anything | An inline offer after the first section, or on exit |
| Autoplaying video with sound | Bounce, and an accessibility failure | Muted, poster-first, play on intent |
| Every section a different colour | Nothing stands out, so the eye stops navigating | One accent; vary rhythm and scale instead |
| A third brand family | Brand voice does not compound; page weight does | Use the second family's other weights |
| Text baked into images | Unreadable to search, screen readers, and translation | Real text over an image, or an `svg` with a title |
| Infinite scroll on a marketing page | The footer becomes unreachable, and so does the pricing link | Pagination, or a shorter page |

If they hear the cost and still want it, build it. It is their product.

## Getting started on a new project

1. Copy `assets/theme.css` in as the first stylesheet, then swap the accent and
   recompute everything derived from it — hover, active, on-dark, tints, alpha
   steps — and measure the pairs. `01-surfaces.md` lists them.
2. Set the type scale before writing any component. On this kind of page the
   scale *is* the design, and retrofitting one means touching every section.
3. Decide the section rhythm once — one spacing value, used everywhere — and do
   not vary it per section.
4. Budget the page before building it: see `04-performance.md`. A budget agreed
   after the hero image is chosen is not a budget.
