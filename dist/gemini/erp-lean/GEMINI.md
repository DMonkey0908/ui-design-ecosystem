# ERP & back-office - UI design system

This project uses the `erp` UI design system. The rules are on disk
next to this file, under `ui/`. **This file is the index, not the system.**

## Applies whenever you are about to

- create, style or lay out **any** user interface — a page, a screen, a
  component, a view
- change how an existing interface **looks**: spacing, colour, type, density,
  states, motion, layout
- add or restyle a **chart**, table, form, dialog, menu, toast or empty state
- answer "make this look better / more professional / cleaner"
- review or critique a UI, someone else's or your own

It applies to any stack — HTML and CSS, React, Vue, Svelte, Tailwind, SwiftUI,
Flutter, a design token file. The rules are about the interface, not the
framework.

It does **not** apply to work that never reaches a screen: build config, data
layers, tests of non-visual logic.

## Do this before writing the first line

1. **Check the tokens.** If the project has a token or theme file, use it. If it
   does not, create one before you write a colour — a hex typed into a component
   is the first step of every palette that later has ninety of them.
2. **Name the surface** you are working on: chrome, canvas, content, floating.
   The treatment follows from the surface, not from the component's name.
3. **Read the reference for what you are building** if it is not already in
   context. A partial memory of a spacing scale produces something almost right,
   which is harder to spot than something obviously wrong.
4. **Write the code.**
5. **Run the review checklist** before reporting the work done.

## Never do these, whatever the request

They are cheap to get right and expensive to retrofit, and every one of them
has shipped from an assistant that had the rules available and did not apply
them.

- Ship an accent colour with a single value when the interface has both light
  and dark surfaces.
- Write a raw colour outside the token file.
- Leave a figure without `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- Remove a focus outline without replacing it.
- Use colour as the only signal for a state.
- Put information or an action behind hover alone. On a touchscreen it is not
  awkward, it is absent.
- Show a spinner for work that finishes in under 300ms, or leave one spinning
  past a second where a skeleton at the real dimensions belongs.
- Animate without honouring `prefers-reduced-motion`, including the end state.
- Start a value axis anywhere but zero when magnitude is being compared.

## When the request conflicts with a rule

Name the cost in one sentence, offer the nearest thing that works, then build
whatever is decided — it is their product. Do not silently comply, and do not
refuse.

Two exceptions are not negotiable, because their cost lands on someone who is
not in the room: the accessibility minimums, and the chart honesty rules. For
those, build the compliant version and say why.

## Say what you applied

When UI work is done, state in one line which pack and which rules shaped it.
A user who cannot see that this system is active cannot tell it from your
default behaviour, and cannot correct it.

## Read the file before you write the code

Opening one reference costs a single tool call. Working from a
half-remembered spacing scale produces something *almost* right, which is
harder for a reviewer to catch than something obviously wrong - and it is
what this system exists to prevent. Do not answer from this index.

### Assets

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ui/assets/theme.css` | the token file - drop into a new project |
| `ui/assets/erp-shell.css` | the shell - grid, sidebar, topbar, main; written entirely in theme tokens |

| `ui/assets/page-template.html` | the page template, including the pre-paint script |

Finish by running `ui/core/99-review.md` and `ui/pack/05-checklist.md`.

## The thesis, so you know what you are applying

**Chrome is dark. Content is white. The accent only marks state and action.**

The sidebar and topbar are near-black and recede. Every surface that holds
something a person reads, compares or edits — cards, tables, dropdowns, form
fields — stays white. One brand accent marks the selected item, the primary
action and the data series, and nothing else.

This is what separates an ERP from a consumer dashboard. A consumer dashboard
uses colour to create delight. An ERP uses colour as a *signal*, so when
something is red it means something. Spend the accent anywhere else and you have
spent the only tool you had for saying "look here".

**Designed for a mouse or trackpad at desk distance.** The method is in `09-input.md`; this is what this domain assumes.

## Hard rules - apply even before you open anything

- Use the project token file. Never write a raw colour outside it; if there is no token file, create one first.
- An accent needs one value per surface. A colour chosen to read on a light surface disappears on a dark one.
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on every figure - tables, tiles, axis labels, tooltips.
- Never remove a focus outline without replacing it. Always `:focus-visible`, never `:focus`.
- Colour is never the only signal for a state. Pair it with an icon, a label or a position.
- Never put information or an action behind hover alone - a touchscreen has no hover, so it is absent rather than awkward.
- Match the waiting affordance to the wait: nothing under 300ms, a skeleton at real dimensions past a second, cancellable progress past five.
- `min-width: 0` on grid and flex children that can hold wide content; `minmax(0, 1fr)` on tracks.
- Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`, and state the end value explicitly - `opacity: revert` yields 1, not your value.
- Start a value axis at zero whenever magnitude is compared.
- Say which rules shaped the result when you are done.

## Not for

- marketing sites, landing pages or anything optimised for a first impression
- consumer mobile apps - the density assumes a mouse and a large screen
- content-first reading experiences - blogs, documentation, editorial
- storefronts and product pages, where the product image is the subject
