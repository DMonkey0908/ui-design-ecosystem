/**
 * Build dist/ and the catalogue from core/ + packs/.
 *
 * The ecosystem's whole maintenance argument rests on this file. Each pack is
 * authored once, as core rules plus a domain overlay; every assistant format is
 * generated. Hand-maintaining N packs x 3 formats is how a system like this
 * drifts, and the drift is silent - two builds disagree and nobody notices
 * until an assistant quotes the stale one.
 *
 *   node tools/build.mjs           build everything
 *   node tools/build.mjs --check   validate and diff, write nothing (CI)
 *   node tools/build.mjs erp       build one pack
 *
 * Outputs, per pack:
 *   dist/claude/<skill>/SKILL.md + core/ + pack/ + assets/   progressive disclosure
 *   dist/gemini/<id>-lean/GEMINI.md + ui/                    small entry, refs on disk
 *   dist/gpt/<id>-lean/AGENTS.md + ui/                       same, for AGENTS.md tools
 *   dist/gemini/<id>.GEMINI.md                               one merged file (paste-in)
 *   dist/gpt/<id>.AGENTS.md                                  one merged file (paste-in)
 *   dist/gpt/<id>.custom-gpt-instructions.md                 copied, if present
 *   dist/cursor/<id>.mdc, dist/copilot/...                   glob-driven rules
 *   dist/snippets/<id>.{project-rules,lifecycle}.md          append to a rules file
 *
 * Lean is the default for a repo; merged exists because a Gem's Instructions
 * field and a Custom GPT take text, not a directory. The difference is about
 * twentyfold, on every request; injectCostTables() measures it.
 *
 * And once, for the catalogue:
 *   dist/index.json                                          machine-readable pack list
 *   the PACKS regions of README.md, docs/README.vi.md, INSTALL.md, llms.txt
 *
 * The catalogue is generated for the same reason dist/ is: a hand-written pack
 * table is a second source of truth, and the copy that goes stale is the one an
 * agent reads when it picks a pack.

 * The lean layout: a small always-loaded entry file next to the references on

 *
 * The merged build puts ~21k tokens in context on every request, including
 * every request that has nothing to do with UI. This gets that down to roughly
 * 800 by keeping only what must always be true - the activation block, the
 * domain thesis in brief, the hard rules - and having the agent open the one
 * reference its task needs, the way the Claude skill already does.
 *
 * The merged single file stays, because a Gem's Instructions field and a Custom
 * GPT take text, not a directory.
 *
 * The risk this trades for is real: an agent can answer from the index without
 * opening anything. The entry file is written to make that feel like the
 * shortcut it is, and the hard rules are there so even a lazy pass is not a
