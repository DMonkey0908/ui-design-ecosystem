A complete design system for internal business software, extracted from a
production ERP front end. It is opinionated on purpose: the decisions below were
made for operators who sit in front of the same five screens for eight hours,
not for a landing page that has to win a first impression.

## The domain thesis

**Chrome is dark. Content is white. The accent only marks state and action.**

The sidebar and topbar are near-black and recede. Every surface that holds
something a person reads, compares or edits — cards, tables, dropdowns, form
fields — stays white. One brand accent marks the selected item, the primary
action and the data series, and nothing else.

This is what separates an ERP from a consumer dashboard. A consumer dashboard
uses colour to create delight. An ERP uses colour as a *signal*, so when
something is red it means something. Spend the accent anywhere else and you have
spent the only tool you had for saying "look here".

## What this pack adds on top of core

Core already requires per-surface accents, visible focus, tabular numerals and
honest axes. This pack decides the things core deliberately leaves open:

- **Density.** 13px base, `8px 12px` table cells, 20+ rows visible at 1080p.
  Comfortable consumer spacing means a third fewer rows per screen, which for an
  operator is a real cost rather than a matter of taste.
- **Surface assignment.** Chrome dark and content white, permanently and
  simultaneously — not a theme toggle.
- **Corner radii inverted from the usual.** Chrome is *sharper* than content
  (2–4px against 6–12px). Square corners on the shell read as structural, a
  window frame; soft corners on content read as touchable. Getting this backwards
  is what makes an ERP look like a consumer app wearing a dark theme.
- **A flat elevation model.** Borders separate things; shadow is reserved for
  what genuinely floats. The shell itself never has one.
- **One container.** A card, with a consistent head. No panel/box/section
  variants — a dense page stays scannable because every container is the same
  shape.

## Non-negotiables

Apply these without being asked.

- **`assets/theme.css` is the only file that names a colour.** Everything else
  spends it. A new colour is a new token there, and a token that only one page
  uses is still better than a literal.
- **Density is the point.** Do not quietly relax it because a screen looks
  tight. Offer a density toggle instead.
- **`tabular-nums` on every figure.** Tables, tiles, axis labels, tooltips.
- **Motion is 0.12s–0.22s.** Anything slower is felt as lag by someone
  performing the same action 200 times a day.
- **One primary button per card.** Two accent-filled buttons and the accent
  stops meaning "the action".
- **The number on a KPI tile is never coloured.** Tinting it green or red passes
  judgement on a figure that may be neither; put the judgement in the sub-line
  where it can be worded.

## What this pack deliberately refuses

Say so briefly if asked for one of these, then offer the alternative and build
whatever is decided.

| Request | Cost | Offer instead |
|---|---|---|
| Glassmorphism on cards | Contrast on the data, which is the whole budget | A border and a flat off-white fill |
| Bigger, airier spacing | A third fewer rows per screen | A density toggle, defaulting to compact |
| A colour per module | The accent stops signalling state | One accent; distinguish by icon and label |
| 16px rounded cards | Reads consumer, not operational | 8px — soft without being playful |
| Animated page transitions | Felt as lag at the 200th repetition | Instant navigation with a 150ms content fade |
| Icon-only buttons, no label | A support ticket, in a tool people are trained on | An icon with a label, or a real accessible name |

If they hear the cost and still want it, build it. It is their product.

## Getting started on a new project

1. Copy `assets/theme.css` in as the first stylesheet, then swap the accent
   block for the client's colour — and recompute the on-dark value.
2. Start the page from `assets/page-template.html`, with `assets/erp-shell.css`
   and `assets/erp-shell.js` beside `theme.css`. The inline script in the
   template's `<head>` is not optional; see the shell reference.
3. Keep the stylesheet order: theme → shell → page.
